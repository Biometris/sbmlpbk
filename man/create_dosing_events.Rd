\title{Create deSolve-Compatible Events from specified dosing scenarios}
\usage{
create_dosing_events(dosing_scenarios)
}
\arguments{
\item{dosing_scenarios}{A list of dosing scenarios, where each element is a
named list following a fixed structure. Each scenario is described by a
scenario \code{type} describing the type of the dosing pattern (single vs.
repeated and bolus vs. continuous) and a \code{target}. Furthermore, all
scenarios must have a \code{time} and an \code{amount}, and may include
the an \code{interval}, a \code{duration}, and an \code{until}
specification, depending on the dosing type.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} formatted for use as the \code{events} argument
in \code{deSolve::ode()}, with columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{var}}{Name of the state variable to which the dose applies (e.g., "A_compartment").}
\item{\code{time}}{Numeric time of the event (in hours).}
\item{\code{value}}{Amount added to the state variable.}
\item{\code{method}}{Typically \code{"add"} for bolus or \code{"rate"} for continuous infusion.}
}
}
\description{
Converts a list of structured dosing scenarios into an event data frame
suitable for use with the \pkg{deSolve} package in differential equation
modeling.
}
\details{
This function interprets each dosing scenario (specified as a named list)
based on its type (e.g., bolus vs. continuous, single vs. repeated) and
generates corresponding time-stamped events for use in PBK or PK simulations.

Recognized \code{type} values:
\itemize{
\item \code{"single_bolus"} – single dose at \code{time}.
\item \code{"repeated_bolus"} – repeated bolus doses between \code{time} and \code{until} at interval \code{interval}.
\item \code{"single_continuous"} – continuous infusion from \code{time} to \code{time + duration}.
\item \code{"repeated_continuous"} – multiple infusions each lasting \code{duration}, repeating every \code{interval} until \code{until}.
}

The target compartment/state variable for each dose is assumed to be specified
in a field like \code{target} or by default as \code{"A_Gut"} if unspecified.
